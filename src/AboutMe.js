    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Growing up, I always loved computers, from videogames to paint editors,
      and I had always wondered how they were made. In middle school I went to
      a game development summer camp, in which we used GameMaker to create games.
      This was the most fun I'd had, and I loved being able to play a game that I
      made myself. From this point on, I loved learning how games were made, watching
      videos on YouTube to learn basic C++ and Javascript. In high school, I took
      the AP Java class, and was able to get an Oracle certification in Java SE7.
      Throughout my college experience, I learned many coding languages, from
      Assembly to C to Python. I enjoyed learning the differences to each one, and
      still enjoy learning new languages when I can.

      I'm a new graduate out of UC Santa Cruz with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
      I'm looking for full-time jobs as a Software Engineer in the Bay Area.
      I have experience with one internship in which I was developing a web/mobile app in a team.
      I worked on the frontend side, using ReactJS and Bootstrap to match my webpages to
      the designs provided by the UI artist. I connected my pages to the backend using
      AJAX, sending requests to the backend server and updating my site with the responses.
